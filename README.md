# Facebook Poster

FacebookPoster is a Python class that allows you to post content to a Facebook page. This class is suitable for automating social media posts.

## Usage

#### 1. Store your Facebook credentials safely
In your project folder, create a ```.env``` file and enter your Facebook page ID and access token, like this:
```
FACEBOOK_PAGE_ID = '1234567890' # replace with your own page ID
PAGE_ACCESS_TOKEN = 'ABCDEFGHI' # replace with your own page access token
```
#### 2. Load the credentials and create an instance of the class
In ```main.py```, load the Facebook credentials and create an instance of the FacebookPoster class. Once you have an instance, you can use its methods to post content to the Facebook page. Use the following code:

```
import os
from facebook_manager import FacebookPoster
from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv()

poster = FacebookPoster(os.getenv("FACEBOOK_PAGE_ID"), os.getenv("PAGE_ACCESS_TOKEN")
```
